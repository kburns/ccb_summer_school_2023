# How to analyze aLENS data


## Generate data to analyze

TODO: Pick example file, commands to have students run the simulation


## Data organization file formats
Data is put into `result/result#-#/` directories to prevent surpassing file limit on ceph.

* Ascii data files: SylinderAscii_#.dat, ProteinAscii_###.dat
  * Human readable positions and orientations
* XML VTK files: ConBlock\_r#\_#.vtp, Sylinder\_r#\_#.vtp, Protein\_r#\_#.vtp
  * Binary files containing all information of systems state. Multiple files for different MPI ranks.
* VTK header files: ConBlock_#.pvtp, Sylinder_#.pvtp, Protein_#.pvtp
  * Human readable files of VTK format for XML files

## `aLENS_analysis` package for dealing with data
Often easier to deal with one file than $10^3$ individual time step files.

`aLENS_analysis` provides collection of ascii and vtk data into HDF5 files for easier analysis.

Other functions:
* Fast common post-processing: autocorrelation functions, density functions, stress calculations, etc.
* Graphing helper functions
* Examples of analysis workflows


## Installing `aLENS_analysis` from git

```
TODO set up pip or conda environment
TODO command for installation
TODO install requirement packages
```
<!-- TODO Make sure that this is easy to install and set up -->


## Running data collection routine

```
analens -A collect
```
Should see new directory in simulation folder called `analysis`
<!-- TODO get picture of data -->


## Commandline interface for hdf5 data

TODO: Get basic commands and images to interact through the commandline


## Viewing data with `HDFView`





<!-- Things to also talk about:
Slowness of ceph
Zipping files 
-->
